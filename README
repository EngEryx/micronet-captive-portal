# Quick Description:
	- A network customer/user management system whose goal is to integrate Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to build a single profile state internet users
	 such that as you move across ISPs, you don't have to create new profile with each of them.
	- Instead, register with one and buy data with one, use it across all the other ISPs.

      MicroNet is software which helps you in controlling and billing your customers for the Internet usage. MicroNet does not require any Client software installations. It uses captive portal technology to show login page in customer browser. Upon connecting to your network (using wireless cards or UTP cable), customer will be prompted to enter valid username and password to get Internet access. After successful login, your customer will see the remaining time and bandwidth quota, expiration date and other relevant info. MicroNet keeps track of customer account and shows warning message when the account is due to expire, helping a customer to refill the account and continue using your service without interruption.
      Software includes billing, statistics and reporting with many useful features. It is hardware independent and you can use any type of access points, routers, switches and other equipment to control your Wi-Fi, WiMax, LAN, Cable, DSL, Satellite and other type of network connections. MicroNet is an advanced RADIUS web platform aimed at managing hotspots and general-purpose ISP deployments. It features user management, accounting, and integration with M-PESA to make it easy for clients to purchase the services conveniently from MicroNet. MicroNet integrates with FreeRADIUS’s database to provide centralized management and control for RADIUS deployments. Those who would find MicroNet to be of use are most notably RADIUS operators and administrators, network and systems administrators, integration engineers and NOC departments. Companies or individuals running hotspot captive portals or remote access technologies such as VPNs are likely to find MicroNet a great fit to manage their user’s database records.
